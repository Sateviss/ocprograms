NAME
  tar - tar archiver for OpenComputers

SYNOPSIS
  tar <function letter> [other options] FILES...

DESCRIPTION
  Allows working with tar archives in OpenComputers.
  It supports the standard tar format + ustar extension.
  (not every feature but enough for most uses)
  
  That makes it a nice tool to exchange multiple files and directories between OpenComputers and "real computers".
  Tar a bunch of files, use pastebin / wget to transmit the archive and extract it at destination.
  Since this program is also able to create tar archives it is possible in both directions!
  
  When you want read from / write to a file you have to use the option -f / --file.
  It then uses the first file given as the archive.
  Else it uses the primary Computronics tape drive. (with the archive starting at the current position)
  
  A function flag is required to indicate what you want to do with the archive.
  Further options can be used to modify the behaviour of the program.
  
  By default the program does not print anything except errors.
  Use --verbose to make it 'talk'!
  
  By default it overwrites every existing file.
  Take care or use options like --keep-old-files!

FUNCTION LETTERS
  -c --create
    create a new tar archive
    
  -r --append
    append to the tar archive
    (tape only unless io.open is going to support rb+ mode)
    
  -t --list
    list contents of tar archive
    
  -x --extract --get
    extract the archive to the current directory
    
  --help
    show usage information
    
OTHER OPTIONS
  -f --file
    tell tar to use the first file parameter as a tar archive
    (When creating an archive, it will be the output file.)
    Without this option the primary tape drive is used instead.
    
  -h --dereference
    follow symlinks (treating them as files / directories)
    
  --exclude=FILE1;FILE2
    exclude a semicolon separated list of files
    The archive file is automaticly excluded when writing to an archive.
    When using the --dereference option it might be necessary to exclude the archive manually.
    (i.e. when following a symlink directs the program to include the archive itself)
    The program will throw an error if an input file grew while being copied to the archive.
    (So it at least terminates when it tries to put the archive into itself.)
    
  -v --verbose
    print out what the program is doing
    If the library auto_progress is installed it also displays nice progress bars on large files.
    
  --keep-old-files
    throw an error when extracting and an output file already exists
  --skip-old-files
    do not overwrite existing files, but continues without errors
  --keep-newer-files
    overwrite existing files only if they are older than the one within the archive
  
  --dir=DIR
    change the reference directory i.e. to extract a tar file in a subdirectory
    (The original tar option is "-C DIR". But shell.parse() does not support an option+parameter combination.)
  
EXAMPLES
  tar --create --file all.tar / --exclude=/mnt
    creates an archive 'all.tar' containing the whole file system except "/mnt".
    
  tar -xf -v another.tar
    extracts the contents of 'another.tar' while showing the user what it's doing.
    
  tar -t
    displays the contents of the tape archive.
    The current position is read as the beginning of the archive.
